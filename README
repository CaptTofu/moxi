moxi - a memcached proxy with spunk and gumption

Dependencies:

   -- libevent, http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)
   -- libmemcached, http://tangent.org/552/libmemcached.html

To compile moxi, after you got the dependencies:

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make

For example, if libevent is installed in /opt/local, you'd do...

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-libevent=/opt/local
  make

Tests:

  # Tests that moxi still behaves like memcached,
  # by passing all the tests that memcached passes...
  #
  make test

  # Tests moxi in a simple proxy topology of...
  #  client <-> moxi <-> memcached
  #
  ./t/moxi.pl

  # Tests moxi in a chained proxy topology of...
  #   client <-> moxi <-> moxi <-> moxi <-> memcached
  #
  ./t/moxi.pl chain

  # Tests moxi in a fanout topology of...
  #   client <---> moxi <---> memcached
  #                       |-> memcached
  #                       |-> memcached
  #                       |-> memcached
  #
  ./t/moxi.pl fanout

  # Tests moxi in a fanout and back in again topology of...
  #   client <---> moxi <---> moxi <-> memcached
  #            |-> moxi <-|
  #            |-> moxi <-|
  #            |-> moxi <-|
  #
  ./t/moxi.pl fanoutin

  # To test moxi proxy cases...
  #
  python ./t/moxi_mock.py

More notes:

If using Linux, you need a kernel with epoll.  Sure, libevent will
work with normal select, but it sucks.

epoll isn't in Linux 2.4 yet, but there's a backport at:

    http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/nio-improve.html

You want the epoll-lt patch (level-triggered).

If you're using MacOS, you'll want libevent 1.1 or higher to deal with
a kqueue bug.

Also, be warned that the -k (mlockall) option to memcached might be
dangerous when using a large cache.  Just make sure the memcached machines
don't swap.  memcached does non-blocking network I/O, but not disk.  (it
should never go to disk, or you've lost the whole point of it)
